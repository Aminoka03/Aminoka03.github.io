<h2>History of a <strong>BIG LOVE</strong></h2>
<p>
  <strong>My story</strong> began in the 11th grade, when we started preparing for <em>EHT</em>, our feelings began to arise.
  But we didn't know about it ourselves and were friends. Good friends. We have become closer and closer to each other.
  We've been through a lot of difficulties together. And they also overcame them. When everything was coming to an end,
  we began to realize that we could not live without each other. Since then, a new time has begun in our life.
  I want to say why I fell in love with him!!!

<ul>
  <li>He is intelligent</li>
  <li>Handsome</li>
  <li>Caring</li>
  <li>And charismatic</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Since we were a year old, I gave him a notebook😇🙃
